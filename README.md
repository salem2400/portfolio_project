PORTFOLIO PROJECT OVERVIEW

WHAT IS A PORTFOLIO PROJECT?

A Portfolio Project is a key showcase piece that you will feature on your résumé, online profiles, and during interviews. It demonstrates your skills, interests, and creativity to potential employers. A completed Portfolio Project typically includes:

    - LANDING PAGE: A dedicated webpage that describes your project.
    - COMPREHENSIVE README: A detailed README.md file that explains the project's purpose, setup, and usage.
    - PROJECT DEMO: A live or recorded demonstration of the project in action.
    - PRESENTATION: A well-structured presentation that outlines the project's objectives, process, and outcomes.
    - BLOG POST: An insightful blog post that reflects on the project, your learning journey, and the technical challenges overcome.

WHY BUILD A PORTFOLIO PROJECT?

Creating a Portfolio Project offers multiple benefits:

    - SHOWCASE YOUR UNIQUE STRENGTHS: It highlights your personal interests, technical skills, and background, making you stand out when networking or interviewing with potential employers.
    
    - EXPERIENCE REALISTIC SCENARIOS: It provides a simulated workplace experience where you develop solutions to loosely defined requirements, break them down into actionable tasks, and implement them within a set timeframe.

    - FOSTER SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING: The project encourages you to explore new technical topics, deepen your understanding of areas covered in your curriculum, or use technology creatively to bring an idea to life.
