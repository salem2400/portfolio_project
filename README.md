#Why build a Portfolio project?
The Portfolio Project serves several different purposes:

Highlights a Student’s unique interests and background when networking, or interviewing with potential employers.
Provides a realistic workplace scenario where engineers create a solution to fit loosely defined requirements, break this down into concrete tasks and implement on a deadline.
Allows for self-directed learning to explore a new technical topic, deepen understanding of a curriculum-covered topic, or use technology to bring an idea to life.
