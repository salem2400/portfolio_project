    <h1>Portfolio Project Overview</h1>

    <h2>What is a Portfolio Project?</h2>
    <p>A Portfolio Project is a key showcase piece that you will feature on your résumé, online profiles, and during interviews. It demonstrates your skills, interests, and creativity to potential employers. A completed Portfolio Project typically includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Landing Page:</strong> A dedicated webpage that describes your project.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive README:</strong> A detailed README.md file that explains the project's purpose, setup, and usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Demo:</strong> A live or recorded demonstration of the project in action.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> A well-structured presentation that outlines the project's objectives, process, and outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Blog Post:</strong> An insightful blog post that reflects on the project, your learning journey, and the technical challenges overcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Build a Portfolio Project?</h2>
    <p>Creating a Portfolio Project offers multiple benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Showcase Your Unique Strengths:</strong> It highlights your personal interests, technical skills, and background, making you stand out when networking or interviewing with potential employers.</li>
        <li><strong>Experience Realistic Scenarios:</strong> It provides a simulated workplace experience where you develop solutions to loosely defined requirements, break them down into actionable tasks, and implement them within a set timeframe.</li>
        <li><strong>Foster Self-Directed Learning:</strong> The project encourages you to explore new technical topics, deepen your understanding of areas covered in your curriculum, or use technology creatively to bring an idea to life.</li>
    </ul>
